# CountyPredictions

In this repository, I attempt to predict the elections on a county-level basis using data from elections since 2000. Data is from [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data).
I use tensorflow to create a model, with the files named either checkpointX.h5 or model.h5. The county level predictions are in predictions.csv, and the state level predictions (with percentages) are in states.csv.
